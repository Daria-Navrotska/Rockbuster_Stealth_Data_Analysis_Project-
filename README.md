# Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project is a business intelligence initiative aimed at helping Rockbuster Stealth LLC transition from a traditional brick-and-mortar movie rental company to a competitive online video streaming service. With the rise of digital platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime, Rockbuster is leveraging its existing movie licenses to enter the digital market.
As part of this project, the data analyst is tasked with importing and analyzing company data using SQL within a PostgreSQL relational database. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that will inform strategic decisions across departments - from customer segmentation to regional sales performance.
This project not only addresses real-world business questions posed by Rockbuster’s management team but also provides hands-on experience in data modeling, querying, and visualization. The final deliverables will include a comprehensive analysis, visual reports, and technical documentation suitable for both business stakeholders and technical teams.

● Where  are  customers  with  a  high  lifetime  value  based?   
● Do  sales  figures  vary  between  geographic  regions?
